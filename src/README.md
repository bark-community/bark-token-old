# BARK Token TypeScript - Draft

## Overview

This repository contains the TypeScript implementation for the BARK Token on the Solana blockchain. The codebase is organized to provide a modular and maintainable structure for different functionalities related to the BARK token.

## File Structure

The project is organized into src/ folder and several files to handle specific functionalities:

1. **`main.ts`**: main functions and logic.
2. **`utils/config.ts`**: Contains configuration settings.
3. **`utils/solana.ts`**: Handles Solana-related operations.
4. **`mint.ts`**: Manages BARK Mint Account creation and initialization.
5. **`src/token.ts`**: Manages BARK token-related operations.
6. **`fees/transactionFees.ts`**: Handles fee-related operations, including fee account creation and withdrawal.
7. **`metadata/metadata.ts`**: Manages Token Metadata operations.
8. **`transactions/transactions.ts`**: Handles various transactions, including BARK transfers and burning.
9. **`utils/utils.ts`**: General utility functions.

## Getting Started

Before executing the main process, ensure to validate and configure your settings:

1. **Validate Configuration**: Check and validate the configuration settings in `config.ts`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. **Execute Main Process**: Run `npm start` or execute the `main.ts` file to initiate the BARK token processes.

## Usage

The BARK token processes include:

- Initializing the Solana connection.
- Creating and initializing the BARK Mint Account.
- Managing BARK token-related operations, including transfers and burning.
- Handling fee-related operations, such as creating fee accounts and withdrawing fees.
- Managing Token Metadata, including initialization.

Refer to specific files and functions for detailed implementations.
